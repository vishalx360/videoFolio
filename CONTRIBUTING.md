## Commit Message Conventions

We follow a specific commit message convention to maintain a clean and organized commit history. We encourage the use of semantic commit messages, which help in understanding the purpose and impact of each commit at a glance. Please use the following format for your commit messages:

Here's an explanation of each part of a semantic commit message:

- `<type>`: Describes the category or type of change. Common types include `feat` (for new features), `fix` (for bug fixes), `docs` (for documentation changes), `chore` (for routine tasks or maintenance), `style` (for code style changes), and more.

- `<scope>` (optional): Represents the scope or context of the change. This can be a module, file, or component affected by the commit.

- `<description>`: Provides a concise and meaningful description of the changes made in the commit.

- `Close #<issue-number>` (optional): If the commit is related to a specific issue or feature request, reference it in the commit message to automatically close the issue when the commit is merged.

For example:

- `feat(auth): add user registration functionality`
- `fix(api): resolve issue with data retrieval`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `chore(tests): refactor unit tests for improved coverage`

Using semantic commit messages helps improve the clarity and maintainability of the commit history. It also aids in generating meaningful changelogs and release notes automatically.

Please ensure that your commit messages follow this convention when contributing to Videofolio. Thank you!
